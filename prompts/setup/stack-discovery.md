# Setup: Stack Discovery

**Purpose:** Scan an existing project and populate `.smiddy/context/stack.md` with the actual tech stack.
**When to run:** Once, immediately after installing Smiddy into a project that already has code.
**Output:** A filled-in `.smiddy/context/stack.md`.

## Instructions

Your job is to discover the project's tech stack by reading its files — not by asking the user to describe it. Infer what you can; ask only what you cannot determine from the project itself.

### Step 1 — Scan for language and runtime indicators

Look for files that reveal the primary languages and their versions:

| File | What it reveals |
|---|---|
| `package.json`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` | Node.js version, JS/TS usage |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript and target |
| `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements*.txt`, `.python-version` | Python version and packaging tool |
| `go.mod` | Go version and module name |
| `Gemfile`, `.ruby-version` | Ruby version |
| `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | Java/Kotlin version and build tool |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust version |
| `*.csproj`, `global.json` | .NET version |
| `composer.json` | PHP version |

Record each language found, its version (if determinable), and its primary use.

### Step 2 — Scan for frameworks and libraries

Read `package.json` (dependencies + devDependencies), `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or equivalent. Identify:

- Web frameworks (React, Next.js, Vue, Django, Rails, FastAPI, etc.)
- Testing libraries (Jest, Vitest, pytest, RSpec, etc.)
- ORM / database clients (Prisma, SQLAlchemy, ActiveRecord, etc.)
- Any other significant libraries worth noting

Do not list every dependency — list only those that meaningfully constrain how the system is built or tested.

### Step 3 — Scan for data stores

Look for configuration files, environment variable references, and connection string patterns:

- Database URLs in `.env`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, config files
- ORM configuration files (e.g., `database.yml`, `alembic.ini`, `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Cache references (Redis, Memcached)
- Queue or stream references (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS, Celery)
- Search engine references (Elasticsearch, Algolia, Typesense)
- Object storage references (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)

If a `.env.example` or similar template exists, prefer it over `.env` (which may not be committed).

### Step 4 — Scan for infrastructure and CI/CD

Look at:

- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` — container runtime and service topology
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `circle.yml` — CI/CD tooling
- `terraform/`, `*.tf`, `pulumi/`, `cdk/` — infrastructure as code and cloud provider
- `k8s/`, `helm/`, `*.yaml` with Kubernetes resource kinds — container orchestration
- Cloud SDK references in CI files — hosting provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Fly, etc.)

### Step 5 — Scan for developer tooling

Look for config files that reveal the toolchain:

| File | Tool |
|---|---|
| `.eslintrc*`, `eslint.config.*` | ESLint |
| `.prettierrc*` | Prettier |
| `ruff.toml`, `.flake8`, `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` | Python linter |
| `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*` | Test runner |
| `vite.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`, `rollup.config.*` | Build tool |
| `package.json` (`packageManager` field) | Package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun) |
| `Makefile` | Common task runner targets |

### Step 6 — Scan for external services

Look in `.env.example`, README, and CI configs for references to third-party services:
- Authentication providers (Auth0, Clerk, Cognito, etc.)
- Payment processors (Stripe, etc.)
- Email services (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
- Monitoring and observability (Datadog, Sentry, OpenTelemetry, etc.)
- Feature flag services, analytics platforms, etc.

For each, note its purpose and the auth method used (API key, OAuth, service account, etc.) if determinable.

### Step 7 — Scan for conventions

Look for evidence of team conventions:
- Branch naming patterns in CI config or CONTRIBUTING.md
- Commit format hints in `.commitlintrc*`, CONTRIBUTING.md, or recent git log
- File structure patterns (feature-based vs. layer-based folders)
- Naming conventions visible in existing source files
- Error handling patterns in existing code

### Step 8 — Fill in the stack file

Write the discovered information into `.smiddy/context/stack.md`. Follow these rules:

- Fill in only what you observed — do not guess or invent versions.
- Leave a cell blank rather than writing "unknown" or "N/A".
- Add a comment in italics below any section where important details were ambiguous.
- Do not remove table rows — leave them blank if the concern does not apply.

### Step 9 — Surface what you could not determine

After writing the file, list any fields you left blank that are likely relevant to the project, and explain what information would be needed to fill them. Keep this list short — only items that will matter during pipeline phases.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `.smiddy/context/stack.md` written with all discoverable fields filled in
- [ ] No invented or guessed values — only observed facts
- [ ] Ambiguities noted inline in the file
- [ ] Remaining unknowns surfaced to the user as a short list
